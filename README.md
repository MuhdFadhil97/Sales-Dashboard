🎯 Personal Project: Interactive Sales Dashboard Using YouTube Dataset

During my leisure time, I took the initiative to develop an interactive sales dashboard using a dataset from YouTube as part of my data analysis and visualization practice.

🛠️ Development Process:

Initial Planning – Identified key requirements and KPIs.

Chart Selection – Chose suitable visuals to represent meaningful insights.

Data Cleaning – Prepared and transformed the dataset to ensure accuracy and consistency.

Dashboard Creation – Built an interactive and user-friendly dashboard.

Deployment – Published the dashboard to my workspace for easy access and sharing.

📊 The result? A visually engaging and interactive dashboard that presents insights in a compelling way.

💡 This project is a great example of how personal interest can be turned into a valuable opportunity to strengthen technical and analytical skills.
